== Player characters

=== Sensar

Sensar is a 19 year old blonde man who's strong point is his brawn rather than 
his brains. From his early teenage years on he had no more family and grew up
living alone in a small house. this unfortunately meant that while he can read, 
he did not get much in the way of an education. And while he is quite friendly
when you rub him the right way, he is also rather unrefined and impatient. 
When provoked he shows his worst side, and has great difficulty in managing 
his anger and rage.

Because of his physical strength, the people who know him like him as an 
unskilled worker or as a monster hunter. But they wouldn't want to ask him for 
any intellectual job more complicated than multiplying two numbers! No one 
in his village is able to beat him in a fist fight though, so he does have the feeling that he's the best fighter around, if not in all of Anistal. He tends
to be a bit cocky, but at the same time he lacks knowledge of the world.

Since he isn' t very wealthy, he loves the idea of fame and fortune, but tends
to spend any money he gets unwisely. For example, he has 2 chimneys and 6 beds because he want to have a big family later, but the house is way too small
for such a family, never mind that he doesn't even have a girlfriend!

Primary ability - Rage - this gives Sensar a damage/hit% boost, but costs about 
10% of his hp. As well, if the original target of Sensar's Rage perishes, then
he also attacks the next person as well. Rage can be used as long as Sensar has
enough hp.

Secondary ability - increased chance to hit critically.

Motivation: Fame and fortune.

Growth: During the story Sensar can learn that the world is a big place indeed,
that there are many things to learn, that it's great to be strong, but strength
needs wisdom to be applied properly, and to manage his anger. Or not. :p


=== Casandra

Casandra is old huntress of about 24 years old. She was adopted by a family of
hunters when she was only 3 or 4 years old. Her original family seems to have
been killed in the war 20 years ago. Since the war, many more monsters are on a
rampage, so business has been steady, but the job is not without dangers.


Nella is her older adoptive sister. Of the two sisters, Nella is the one who has
the most physical prowess, while Casandra hunts her prey using magic. Casandra
has been fascinated by magic, especially fire magic, since she was a child. She 
turned out to be a natural talent, and buy the time she was 12, she was 
scorching monsters here and there. Physically she is not so strong because she 
is hampered by her bad lungs which have suffered smoke damage, most likely
when she was a child, during the war.

Casandra and Nella have worked for officials from several cities and villages.
But normally those officials request that they work under a non disclosure agreement. The officials like to take credit for themselves for getting rid
of the monsters but in reality they pay hunters to do the dirty jobs.

Because of her natural talent with magic, but also because of the lack of
recognition for her and her family, Casandra has grown yup slightly arrogant,
stuck up, hung up on details, and unpleasant to others. Nevertheless, when you
get on her good side, she will show that she is a clever person without bad
intentions, who wants to enjoy life. A person who is in essence exasperated at
the idiocy of some of her fellow humans, but not above admitting that she is not
perfect herself. A person who expects more from others, but who is also always looking to better herself.

Motivation: Get the staff for herself, use if for her own magic power and maybe
become queen of the hill in a small village here or there. Surely she'd make a
better mayor than the idiots she's had to work for?

Primary ability - Boost - this ability increases Casandra's Aura and Spirit by
50% to cast a spell... however, the spells costs 150% the normal MP amount.
Not all spells benefit from boosted Aura/Spirit. Boost can be used once per
battle.

Secondary ability - Casandra is 80% resistant to paralysis and sleep.

=== Ayla

Ayla is a young lady of about 20 years old. Though she is well-to-do
she is a thief for the thrill of stealing. She's a fun loving girl, a bit
tomboyish, with quick fingers and a charming personality. Sometimes she
also doubles as an entertainer or a prestidigitator. She doesn't get found out
stealing very often, but likes to hop from town to town since she gets bored
soon. she has a sharp attention to her surroundings. however on her bad side, you'll see that sometimes she can be a bit superficial and impatient.

Motivation: Ayla wants to find the staff, get money for it from Nostik,
steal it from him, and then sell it for some more cold, hard cash. And maybe
steal it again. As long as she has fun with the ride.

Primary ability - Steal - Ayla can steal items from her enemies... as long as there is something to steal. Steal can be used repeatedly.

Secondary ability - If alone, Ayla can only be surprised by the enemy roughly 1% 
of the time, and she has a 33% chance to surprise them. If with a partner, the
heroes are only surprised 5% of the time, and have a 20% chance of surprising 
the enemies. The normal rates are 10% for both being surprised and causing
surprise.

=== Temmin

Tenmin is a young man of about 27 years old. He is a knight in service of his 
master, who serves the King of XXX. Tenmin is a professional 
knight and warrior and tends to be on the serious side. He is loyal to his 
master, but when he fights in a team, he is always looking out for his comrades.
If you catch him in a good moment you'll see he does have a good sense of humor
and likes to laugh and joke once in a while.

Motivation: Tenmin wants to fulfill his mission to his master. He will make sure
that the staff is safe to give to Nostik, and that Nostik is not going to use 
the staff for a bad reason.

master Barl encountered Binderak on rthe run from Malkaron. Binderak tried to 
use the Staff when Barl recognised it and demanded that he yield it. But 
the Staff went haywire and a gang of uncontrollable monsters appeared. 
Binderak ran for it and Barl held the monsters at bay allowing Noslom to 
escape.

Noslom regrets loosing his old master and has been looking for him ever since.
although everyone says that Barl is dead, Noslom believes Barl is still alive
since no trace of him was found.

and hopefully find out about the whereabouts of Barl.

taught, and trained in the ways of defending justice and righteousness.
Ajathar was an ace student and now he has taken up the vows of a monk himself.
While he is very bright, he is a bit of a book worm and not very interested 
in the outside world.

Ajathar's is somewhat naive and "green", but he's also very intelligent. He 
sometimes has trouble dealing with dealing with some of the realities he
encounters  but he always works to do what's right and defend people. 

Ajtahar's superior, Cid, sends him out on a mission to investigate the Staff,
ince cid feels that Ajtahar needs to get out of the books and face reality to 
truly learn what life is like.

realizes that going out in the world is a great occasion for him to learn 
something new.

are undead, Prayer will attempt to destroy them. If there are no undead present,
Prayer will cure the party members a bit.

=== Corin

Corin is a young man of 24 years old. He is a Rune Knight. The Rune Knights 
are a secret organization that has as goal to protect and help the people of 
Anistal.

Only they know the secret of engraving the power of the elements into weapons.
The Rune knights wield this power to fight evil, or at least what they see
as such, all whilst staying in the shadows.

Since corin always has to get in action whenever the peopleget into problems, he 
has the habit of seeing the worst situations, and people at their worst. This
has made him a bit of a pessimist and he's not above cracking a cynical joke 
once or twice. But if ou get to know him and get close to him, you'll see he's 
a warm hearted man underneath his prickly shell.

Motivation: Corin is a classic hero who believes in fighting evil. He has his 
doubts about Nostik since unlike most the RuneKnights know that he might have 
been involved with Malkaron.

SpecialSkill: - Infuse - this allows Corin to cast an elemental type spell on 
himself. The different spells give Corin resistance (and weakness) to certain 
elements and boost other combat stats as well. Infuse can be used once per 
battle.

Secondary ability - Corin's resistance versus Earth, Fire, Air, and Water rises
with his level.

=== Sarina

Sarina is a young woman of about 26 years old. She is a lumberjack by
profession. She comes form a large but relatively poor family, and is the
youngest child. As such she had to fight her bothers often and a result
she became a physically strong woman. During her work as a lumberjack
she sometimes encounters monsters, but she's learned to deal with them swiftly 
in order to keep on working efficiently.

Sarina also has a feminine and caring side. Even though her older brothers
should help her parents, she has allowed them to go out in the world to find
fortune. She has taken responsibility of taken care of her parents in stead.
Sarina was able to save up some money to allow her parents to live off for a 
few years. But it's not going to be enough when they get older and unable
to work themselves. 

Sarina is a hard worker and helpful to others to a fault. She dreams of 
finding a good husband and settling down, but first she want to be sure her 
parents will be able to retire comfortably. If anything bad could be said about
her then it's that she should stand up for herself more and not let other 
people's desires overrule her own so much. For the rest she has a lovely 
disposition and a kind, loving heart.

Motivation: Sarina hopes to earn a comfortable pension for her parents, so she 
can finally pursue her own dreams.

Primary ability - Sweep - attack all targets at once. Critical hits are possible
but the screen doesn't flash. The attack is not as powerful as a single attack by
Sarina. Sweep can be used as long as there is more than one target to attack. As
well, Sweep is only possible with bladed weapons (axe, sword, and dagger).

Secondary ability - I've been wondering what to put for this, but for now I have
given her some resistance to fire and lightning.


== Non-player characters

=== Nostik

Nostik pretends to be a cryptic old man hiding out on a smaller island of
the Anistal archipelago. However, he is the current Archwizard, responsible
for safekeeping the first half of the Staff of Xenarum. He is now hiding
out for fear that Malkaron may find him and kill him out of revenge. However,
his goal is to obtain the Staff, ostensibly to put it into safe keeping again.

He claims that Malkaron forced him to reveal the location of the first part of
the staff and then enslaved him using it's power. He was finally able to escape
Malkaron's grasp and even tried to steal the Staff from him. However, Binderak
apparently had the same plan and stole the staff first, before Nostik could get
it.

Nostik used his scrying skills to find people who could be useful in helping 
him find the Staff of Xenarum. He used magical means to transfer notes to
summon those people he deemed useful to his goals.

.Hidden agenda
Nostik was not really enslaved by Malkaron. Rather, he joined Malkaron
willingly as one of his tree lieutenants because he felt sympathy for
Malkaron's goals and Malkaron.

When he felt Malkaron was going out of line with the staff, he decided to steal it, however, in the deepest of his heart, it was the desire for power that 
drove him. He wanted to become the leader of the hordes and conquer 
However, he is still fearful of Malkaron's revenge at his betrayal, that is why
he is hiding away.

He wants the adventurers he summoned to collect the whole staff for him so he 
can use it to become the new ruler of Anistal, "for the sake of the people", 
or so he deludes himself.

=== Malkaron

Malkaron is the "Dark Lord" who had somehow obtained the first half of the
Staff of Xenarium, and used it to summon and control hordes of enemies 20 
years ago. Went on a rampage though Anistal until the Staff was stolen
by Binderak. Then Malkaron disappeared and wasn't heard of again. It was even 
rumored that one of the more powerful summoned monsters consumed Malkaron.

When Malkaron was still seen, he would wear a jet black armor that covered all
of his face and body. However, Malkaron's voice was said to be surprisingly
clear and sharp for such an impressive, commanding person.

.Hidden agenda
In reality Malkaron is still alive and wants to find the whole of the staff 
back. Malkaron wants to use the staff to create an orderly society ruled by
fear. In this way, Malkaron wants to honor the oath of Mallow. Malkaron also
wants vengeance against Nostik for his betrayal, although that is a secondary
concern.

=== Binderak

Binderak was one of the three lieutenants of Malkaron. He stole the half of
Staff of Xenarum from Malkaron 19 years ago before the Battle of Cooked hill,
in the hope it would make him all powerful. However, since he was a pure
warrior who knew little about magic, he was unable to use the staff at all.
So he ran away and hid in the Kingdom Of Esteria.

He has trying to figure out ever since how to use the staff. But he has difficulties understanding magic, and he is reluctant to aks anyone for help,
so his investigations of the Staff have been largely unfruitful. But the staff
has slowed down his aging, and made him much more powerful physically.
Now, even Malkaron would not dare attack him directly.

=== Chayin

Chayin is the current Archwizardress, and guards the second half of the Staff
of Xenarum. She is currently keeping a low profile for fear that Malkaron
would seek out the half of the Staff left in her care.

=== Nella 

Nella is a professional hunter. Nella hails from a family of professional 
hunters, who clean out monster nests when they are dangerous or bothersome to humans, or escort officials through dangerous areas. Since the war 20 years ago, many more monsters are on a rampage, so business has been steady, but the job is not without dangers.

Nella is Casandra's older sister. She is 37 years old. About 21 years ago,
Nella found Casandra when she was out hunting.  Cassandra was but a young child
lying on the scene of a battle in a conflict of those days, near a burnt cart.
At first Nella thought it was hopeless, but then she noticed that Casandra still 
breathed. Nella took care of Casandra's wounds as well as she could and 
carefully carried her home. Nella's family has since taken care of Casandra 
as their own and adopted her as their daughter.

Of the two sisters, Nella is the one who has the most physical prowess, while 
Casandra hunts her prey using magic.

=== Barl

Barl was the old master of Noslom. In the time of the war 20 years ago, he was 
a very famous Sage of about 40 years old who traveled the land preaching peace 
and understanding as well as researching history and magic. He disappeared 20
years ago when he and Noslom met Binderak. Binderak used the staff and it 
went haywire, summoning an uncontrolled gang of monsters. Barl fought
those monsters and is said to have been killed while defeating them.

In reality Barl is still alive and is using his disappearance as a cover to investigate the truth behind the Dark Lord and the Staff. In 20 years there is much he has found out, and he knows something of the link between Malkaron 
and Mallow.

Barl is also looking into ways to get the staff back from Binderak and seal it away, but since Barl is forced to work from the shadows, he hasn't been very successful in this endeavor.

=== Largon

Largon is the master of Corin, and the last master of the Rune Knights.
The Rune Knights are a secret organization that has as goal to protect and
help the people of Anistal.

Only they know the secret of engraving the power of the elements into weapons.
The Rune knights wield this power to fight evil, or at least what they percieve 
as such, all whilst staying in the shadows.

Since the last war, the amount of rune knights has dwindled, and now only
Largon and Corin seem to remain.

in the land, and so is unsafe for any adventurer to travel there.

will let you pass. He will give you an encrypted message which you must deliver 
to Derig. The message's contents are encrypted, so you cannot read what is said.

Once Derig reads the note, he will respond and Tsorin will let you continue 
on your journey.

=== Mallow

Mallow is a is a mysterious woman who is related to Nostik. About 21 years ago,
when she was only 23, before Malkaron rose to power, she and her family were on
the run for a fierce regional conflict. Her family's cart got caught in the
crossfire and was set ablaze. Her husband was killed instantly. Mallow escaped
with her daughter but the child died from smoke inhalation. She had no time to
mourn her family, so intense was the battle, and she had to run for her life.
From that moment she took a solemn oath and swore to do whatever it would take 
to bring peace to Anistal.

After she escaped, she went to look for ways to bring het oath into reality.
From those days she wore nothing but black clothes in sign of her perpetual
mourning. However, she was but a woman alone with no followers. She investigated
the possibilities until she heard the legend of the Staff. Determined, she went
to look for the Archwizard Nostik to try and make him reveal the location of
his half of the Staff by any means possible. She pretended to want to be his
student of magic.

Nostik at first protested that she should study with
the the Archwizardress Chayin. Mallow insisted and Nostik caved, most likely
because he also felt attracted to her. Mallow noiced Nostik attraction,
but let time pass to quell any suspicion and to learn the details of Magic.
After all, she would need that knowledge to use the Staff once she obtained it.
Finally when the time was right, Mallow seduced Nostik and took the medallion
from him which was both the key and the indication for the location of his
half of the staff.

Mallow snook out and immediately set for the place where the Staff was hidden.
When she arrived there, she opened the door with the medallion, and took the
Staff. But to her surprise, someone called out to her and asked her what she 
would use the staff for. It was Nostik who had woken op son after she left and 
who was hot on her track.

Mallow explained calmly that she wanted to use the staff to bring peace to
Anistal, and that she would kill Nostik if he opposed her. To her surprise,
Nostik agreed with her goal and implored her to allow him to become her 
follower. While she had her doubts about Nostik, Mallow allowed him
to become her first lieutenant.

They tried various ways of using the Staff, but they were only able to summon
and controlling monsters, or reinforcing Opal. They also sought various ways
ways to raise a peacekeeping army, but they were not very successful in either
pursuit. Only Binderak and a few of his men were willing to join. Then, one day
in town, Malory heard that before, when the monsters were common, humans would
band together and fight each other much less often.

It is then that she got the idea to use the staff's ability to summon and
control the monsters to bring peace to Anistal. She would willingly play the 
role of "Dark Lord" in order to unite the people against her in the clear hope that it would bing peace. And if per chance they failed, and the "dark lord" 
was to conquer all of Anistal, then that "dark lord" would be able to enforce peace though fear of "his" hordes.

Form that day, 20 years ago, Mallow and Nostik conjured a horde of monsters to 
unite the people of Anistal against them. Mallow started to wear a full, black
suit of armor that hid her face and figure, and started to call herself the 
"Dark Lord"... and so the back story of KQ Renaissance began...
