== Introduction

In the seventh parallel universe, in a distant galaxy shines Kox Sol,
the white star. And around Kox Sol orbits Kox Quona, a planet of magic and
monsters. Thousands of years ago, human kind landed on Kox Quona but
those days have been long forgotten. Nevertheless, since that beginning,
humans have tried to make a home out of this strange, hostile world world.

At first the monsters first proved to be a serious obstacle. No matter how many were killed, new monsters kept on crawling out of the sea. And some of these monsters wielded dangerous and mysterious powers over the elements. But then,
humans found that they too could learn to manipulate and control these
energies that emanated from the planet. They called this power
"Magic" and those who could control it "Wizards". And with Magic, humans
were finally able to establish safe havens for themselves in the wild lands
of Kox Quona.

One of the famous legends about such a safe haven on Kox Quona is that of
Anistal, the blessed islands. According to the legends, the Wizards of Anistal
of the academy of Xenarum had perfected their craft, and created the most
powerful magical artifact Kox Quona had ever seen, the Staff of Xenarum.
The Wizards of Anistal then used the Staff of Xenarum to envelop the Anistal
archipel in a magical bubble that would isolate it from the rest of Kox
Quona in order to keep all monsters out.

The side effect of this was that Anistal was now no longer visible from the
outside, and anyone who tried to reach the islands would find that it seemed
as though they had disappeared completely. But for the in habitants of Anistal
an era of peace had begun. No more did new monsters crawl out of the seas. And
so, before long, humans eradicated most of the beasts left on the islands. The
monsters had become nothing more but bad memories and stories to scare children.

The Wizards of Anistal, worrying that their work would be undone, broke the
staff of Xenarum in two parts. The Archwizard and head Archwizardess of Xenarum
both hid one of the two parts without revealing the location of 
the other part to each other. Since that day, the knowledge location of each of
the halves has been passed down by the Archwizard and Archwizardess 
on their deathbeds to their most trusted student.

And so the blessed islands of Anistal enjoyed hundreds of years of peace. 
But unfortunately, the absence of monsters soon started to prove problematic 
in an unexpected way. Before Anistal became a safe haven, the people sometimes would sometimes fight with each other. But normally, they would solve 
these problems soon because they were forced to band together to fight the 
never ending return of monsters from the sea.

But now, with no more monsters to force humans to work together, conflicts began
to erupt here and there. Crime, theft and murder were on the rise. And some
desired for power, wealth and fame. Finally, the peace was lost and a great war broke out on the Anistal islands.

One of the most ruthless armies involved in this war was the black host of Malkaron. Malakron had somehow obtained a one of the two part of the staff,
and with it he was somehow able recruit and to control monsters. His beastly
hordes laid waste to much of Anistal and no one seemed able to stop him.
But at the battle of the Crooked Hill, Malakron's beasts went out of control
and his army dissipated. 

Malakron himself was no where to be found. Rumor went
that Malakron's half of the Staff of Xenarium had been stolen from him.
Malakron then would have been unable to control his horde, and would have been forced to run and hide. Months passed, and Malakron wasn't seen nor heard from. Some even rumored that his own beasts had devoured him. Likewise Malakron's half
of the staff of Xenarium seemed to have disappeared.

Whatever truly happened, the people of Anistal breathed a sigh of relief.
Tired of the war, they settled their differences in a treaty and started
rebuilding their cities.

Nineteen years have passed since then, and peace seems to have returned to the
blessed islands of Anistal. But what really happened with Malakron? And
where is the Staff of Xenarium? Eight young people's lives will take a sudden
turn as they get involved in the search for that magnificent artifact.
They are summoned to participate in the KQ Renaissance!
