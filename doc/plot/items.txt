== Plot Items

=== Staff Of Xenarum

The Staff of Xenarum is a powerfuil staff and the object of the quest in KQ.

The Staff was used in days long by to place Anistal in a bubble named
"the Mantle" to separate it from the rest of the planet of Kox Quona. Since
that time, for fear that the Mantle be undone, it has been split in two
halves, the male half and the female half, and eachpart was hidden individually.
Even one of the two halves has considerable power, but not enough to undo the
Mantle.

The Staff of Xenarum does not grant any new skills or abilities to it's wielder,
but amplifies the ones he or she has, depending on their resolve and strength 
of will. Therefore, to one without knowledge of magic or mental resolve, 
the staff will be almost useless.

Furthermore, if someone without knowledge uses the staff or any of it's halves,
it will affect the Mantle and portals may be created that let monsters come in 
from the seas of Kox Quona.
